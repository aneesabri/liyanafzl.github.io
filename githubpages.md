# GITHUB PAGES AND DOCUMENTATION 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn't fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share. I think everyone must make it a habit to document whenever we learn a new thing so that it does not get erased even if we forget.

Maintaining github pages is pretty simple. All you have to do is to follow a few simple steps and you can share you're own online document to anyone anywhere. Sounds awesome , doesnn't it..

## STEPS

1. Create an account in github. If you already have one, well and good. If not just click on the link given:

2. Create your project's repository. Login to your GitHub account and go to https://github.com/new or click the New repository icon from your account homepage.

A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab. Some of the softwares that were told to be installed were:

* AutoCAD ( Ex. : EagleCAD, Rhinoceros)
It is used for creating blueprints for our designs in mind.

* Cura 
It is a 3D printing slicing application. This is the software that is used to turn our design image into a format that can be used by the 3D printer to print the corresponding 3D object.

We also created accounts in various sites that may be useful :
* GrabCAD
* vimeo ( for sharing videos)
* Instructables
