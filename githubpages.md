# GITHUB PAGES AND DOCUMENTATION 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn't fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share. I think everyone must make it a habit to document whenever we learn a new thing so that it does not get erased even if we forget.

Maintaining github pages is pretty simple. All you have to do is to follow a few simple steps and you can share you're own online document to anyone anywhere. Sounds awesome, doesn't it..

## STEPS

1. Create an account in github. If you already have one, well and good. If not just click on the link given:
[I want to create an account in github](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)

2. Create your project's repository. Login to your GitHub account and go to https://github.com/new or click the New repository icon from your account homepage.

4. Now that your repository is ready. Create a readme file .

5. Now you are ready to go. Open the Readme file and edit it using markdown, html or anything of your choice.
