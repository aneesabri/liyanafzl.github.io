### DAY 2 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn't fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share. I think everyone must make it a habit to document whenever we learn a new thing so that it does not get erased even if we forget.

A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab. Some of the softwares that were told to be installed were:

* AutoCAD ( Ex. : EagleCAD, Rhinoceros)
It is used for creating blueprints for our designs in mind.

* Cura 
It is a 3D printing slicing application. This is the software that is used to turn our design image into a format that can be used by the 3D printer to print the corresponding 3D object.

We also created accounts in various sites that may be useful :
* GrabCAD
* vimeo ( for sharing videos)
* Instructables
* Thingiverse
