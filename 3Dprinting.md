## Softwares Required:

A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab. Some of the softwares that were told to be installed were:

* AutoCAD ( Ex. : EagleCAD, Rhinoceros)
It is used for creating blueprints for our designs in mind.

* Cura 
It is a 3D printing slicing application. This is the software that is used to turn our design image into a format that can be used by the 3D printer to print the corresponding 3D object.
