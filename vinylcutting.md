# VINYL CUTTING

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).

So, you could say vinyl cutting can be used to make your own customised stickers etc..It is fun to work with. We can just design anything and then cut it using the software
* CutShop
