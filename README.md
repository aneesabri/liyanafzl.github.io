## Something about me

My name is Liyana Fizal. I am currently pursuing a degree in B.tech Computer science. I am going through my final year of course. I am pretty enthusiastic when it comes to learning something new on technology.

### FABLAB at MESCE

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality.  It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could  turn one's imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well ... explore and have fun.

###DAY 1

Day 1 went well with the introduction. We got an overview of how the two weeks are going to be spent at FABLAB. 

###DAY 2 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future.
A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab.
