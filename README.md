## FABLAB Experience

### Something about me

My name is Liyana Fizal. I am currently pursuing a degree in B.tech Computer science. I am going through my final year of course. I am pretty enthusiastic when it comes to learning something new on technology.

### FABLAB at MESCE

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one's imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well ... explore and have fun.

### DAY 3

Today we learnt how to use the AutoCAD software in order to make blueprints for our designs in mind. We used Rhinoceros Corporate (version for 64-bit OS).
First of all 2D shapes can be constructed easily by the given tools. In order to convert a 2D image to 3D image we use the following command:

<B> COMMAND : </B> 
ExtrudeCrv 

The required dimensions can be given.

Next, in order to create a solid object we use the command: 

** COMMAND : ** *Cap *

In order to subract portions of the object we use the command : 

** COMMAND : ** *BooleanDifference*

The appropriate surfaces to be subtracted and those to be kept can be selected according to our choice.

Once the designed object is ready we converted it into STL format through the following steps:

>File
 >Export selected
  > STL format
  >Name the file and click print
  
 Next we use the CURA software that has been installed earlier and then set it accordingly in order to print it using the 3D printer.
 We made the following settings.
 Profile : Fine
 Material : PLA
 Infill : 50%
 Support : Use 
 
Then click Save to removable drive. Now the image is ready to be fed to the 3D printer in order to print it by inserting the memory card consisting the image.

** Electronics Production **

We were given a few basic things to learn about electronics production.
A useful tutorial can be referred by AJITH KUMAR MG.

Here, we use the SBT format.

We witnessed how we could set the origin on the CNC machine.
