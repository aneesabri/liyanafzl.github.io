### FABLAB at MESCE

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality.  It consists of a lot of machine such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I will be sharing their images later.

###DAY 1

Day 1 went well with the introduction. We got an overview of how the two weeks are going to be spent at FABLAB. 

###DAY 2 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future.
A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab.
