## Something about me

My name is Liyana Fizal. I am currently pursuing a degree in B.tech Computer science. I am going through my final year of course. I am pretty enthusiastic when it comes to learning something new on technology.

### FABLAB at MESCE

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one's imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well ... explore and have fun.

### DAY 1

Day 1 went well with the introduction. We got an overview of how the seven days were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more .

Here are some of the machines set up at our FABLAB. 

This is the one and only 3D printer. I was fascinated by this machine whenI learnt how we could transform 2D images( in STL format) to an actual 3D object.

The one below is the CNC cutting / PCB milling machine.

### DAY 2 

Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn't fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share. I think everyone must make it a habit to document whenever we learn a new thing so that it does not get erased even if we forget.

A few softwares were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab. Some of the softwares that were told to be installed were:

* AutoCAD ( Ex. : EagleCAD, Rhinoceros)
It is used for creating blueprints for our designs in mind.
* Cura 
It is a 3D printing slicing application. This is the software that is used to turn our design image into a format that can be used by the 3D printer to print the corresponding 3D object. 

We also created accounts in various sites that may be useful :
* GrabCAD
* vimeo ( for sharing videos)
* Instructables
* Thingiverse
