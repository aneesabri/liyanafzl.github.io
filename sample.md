### DAY 1

Day 1 went well with the introduction. We got an overview of how the seven days were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more .

Here are some of the machines set up at our FABLAB. 

This is the one and only 3D printer. I was fascinated by this machine whenI learnt how we could transform 2D images( in STL format) to an actual 3D object.
